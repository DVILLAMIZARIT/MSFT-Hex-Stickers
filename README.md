# MSFT-Hex-Stickers

It's very fashionable for tech folks to use hexagon-shaped stickers to tessellate their laptops.
I wanted to create some hex stickers for fans of [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) and, more specifically,
the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.

These stickers are designed to the same specifications as the excellent stickers in
[maxogden](https://github.com/maxogden)'s [hexbin](https://github.com/maxogden/hexbin) repository.

There are many places you can have these stickers printed.  I personally recommend [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com/).
